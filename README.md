# SeedMass

This repository contains data analysis scripts for my dissertation first chapter on spatial, temporal, and phylogenetic variation in seed mass.

## Q1: Spatial Patterns of Seed Mass

The script `code/Q1_SpatialPatterns.R` looks at general spatial patterns in seed mass across the western US

Main models:
  - Fits GLM and GLMM models to test how seed mass varies by plant growth form & duration (annual/perennial)
  - Assesses geographic gradients in seed mass using latitude, longitude, and elevation
  - IDW analysis across the entire western US
  - General summary of the collection range
